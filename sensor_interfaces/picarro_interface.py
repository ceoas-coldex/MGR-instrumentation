# -------------
# Establishes serial communication with the Picarro spectrograph. Currently has only been tested on the G2401 model 
# that measures gas concentrations, but should work with any Picarro that supports a Remote Command Interface. The Picarro 
# must be properly configured (Picarro Utilities > Setup Tool > Port Manager) to enable the interface, see README for full docs
